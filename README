Description:

	A small python program I wrote to help me debug IP multicast
	problems in the network. It both sends and receives multicast 
	on a specified group address and port and prints out what it 
	receives with periodic statistics.

	If running between machines on different subnets, IP multicast 
	routing	needs to be working in the network. It may also be necessary 
	to tweak the TTL parameter in the program source code, depending 
	on such factors as the size of your network, the location of the 
	rendezvous point relative to the nodes, and any TTL threshold
	limits configured on routers. In general, if multicast traffic 
	isn't reaching some nodes, the problem might be fixed by raising 
	the TTL.

Pre-requisites:

	Python 2.7.x or Python 3.x
	A platform that supports IP multicast and POSIX threads.

Platforms:

	Tested on the following platforms:
		Solaris 8, 9, and 10
		Linux 2.x
		Mac OS X
	May work on other platforms that have multicast and pthreads

Installation:

1. (as root) make install
