Todo List for future versions

* Record hopcount; have sender put his startingttl (sttl) in
  the payload. And have receiver compute the hopcount from the
  received TTL in the IP header.
* Keep window of last N sequence numbers seen for a source, and
  report missed packets, out-of-order packets etc.
* Support a daemon mode, which goes into the background and reports
  results via syslog.
* Support IPv6 Multicast.
* Define a structured payload with XML, and a way to customize the
  payload.
* Send warnings on threshold of silence from specified sources
* Cryptographically authenticate/encrypt packets, so that only 
  authorized listeners can decode it.
